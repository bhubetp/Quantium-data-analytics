# Quantium Retail Analytics Virtual Internship – Data Analysis (Python)

This repository showcases my completed work for **Quantium's Retail Strategy & Analytics Virtual Experience** hosted on the Forage platform. The project focuses on analysing customer purchasing behaviour and assessing the impact of a chip category trial across selected stores.

## Project Overview

The analysis is divided into two main parts:

### Task 1: Customer Segment Analysis
- Cleaned and merged transaction and customer data
- Performed exploratory data analysis on customer spending behaviour by segment
- Identified high-value customer groups and purchasing patterns
- Created visualisations to support data-driven recommendations

### Task 2: Trial Impact Assessment
- Selected control stores using similarity metrics (correlation & magnitude distance)
- Assessed the trial’s effectiveness using pre-trial vs trial period comparisons
- Conducted statistical testing (T-tests) to determine significance
- Included customer uplift analysis and detailed visual comparisons
